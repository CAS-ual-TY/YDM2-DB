Once per turn: You can target 1 face-up monster you control; send 1 Normal Monster from your hand or Deck to the GY, and if you do, the targeted monster gains ATK/DEF equal to the Level of the monster sent to the GY x 100, until the end of this turn (even if this card leaves the field). You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 \"Burst Stream of Destruction\" from your Deck to your hand.",
