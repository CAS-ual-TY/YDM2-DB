You can target 1 \"Fabled\" monster in your GY; discard 2 cards, and if you do, add that target to your hand. You can only use this effect of \"Stairway to the Fabled World\" once per turn. If your \"Fabled\" monster attacks an opponent\u0027s monster while you have less cards in your hand than your opponent, it gains ATK equal to difference between the number of cards in the hands x 200, during damage calculation only. You can only activate 1 \"Stairway to the Fabled World\" per turn.",
